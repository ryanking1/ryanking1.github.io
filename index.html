    	<h3>Why I Joined Epicodus</h3>
    	<p class="padded">
    		I applied for Epicodus and Portland Code School over a year ago. Well, I guess I should say I completed the coding tests on each website, but never actually sent in my application. I had finished my AA degree, and been accepted to WSU vancouver, which seemed like the safe choice. My parents wanted me to finish a degree in Computer Science, so I went. At WSUV I spent a year learning engineering physics, calculus, and even took a technical writing class. None of which prepared me for actual coding. I suppose it might be useful if I'm designing a program that performs physics or calculus functions, but I won't remember any of those functions without using them on a regular basis. So I did some research on what employers are looking for most in interviews, and talked to a friend who had gone the code school route. And what I learned was that roughly 50% of what you learn in a CS program won't translate into appliclabe job skills. Also, pair programming skills and a portfolio of work are key elements in the job search. So I decided to skip the crippling student debt, and enroll at Epicodus. It's only been a week, but I'm already creating websites, and the peer feedback from pair programming has been a great tool for measuring my progress.

    	<h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
      <p class="padded">
          	When I'm not at Epicodus or at work, I enjoy playing soccer and rock climbing. I started soccer when I was only about 4, and have played ever since. Once I became old enough I started playing very competitively, which took a little of the fun out of it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed winning tournaments, and have an entire box full of old medals and trophies, but the uphill windsprints in 90 degree heat weren't fun at all. Between traveling all over Washington and Oregon, plus practice all year round, I didn't have time for much else as a kid. I quit playing after high school for a few years, but recently got back into playing indoor. This time it's just random pickup games on Friday nights, so it's nothing but casual fun.

      <p class="padded">
          	My new competitive hobby is rock climbing. A little over a year ago my friend David invited me to take an intro to climbing class with him at our local climbing gym. I'd always wanted to try it, but it seemed pretty complicated, and the risk of falling to my death was a bit of a deal breaker for me. But I decided that if David could do it then so could I. As soon as we took that first class we were both hooked. I was there every day the first week, until eventually it felt like both my arms were going to stop working, so I had to take a break. Oh, and the blisters were another great perk of beginning climbing. But we stuck with it, developed calluses instead of blisters, and have been going 2-3 times a week since. It's a bit discouraging at first, since everyone else seems so much better, but I'd recommend it to anyone. It's worth it when you finally finish a route you've been stuck on for days/weeks. If you've ever debugged some code, and tried every possible solution before it finally worked, then you know the feeling. It's worth all the frustration in the end.

      <h3>Plans After Epicodus</h3>
      <p class="padded">
        	I don't have any grand dreams for the immediate future after graduating from Epicodus. I imagine the job search will be tough, as there are a lot of us students that will be going after the same jobs. And from what I've heard the first job is always the least favorite. But that's where you gain valuable skills and experience for your move to the next job. So that's exactly what I plan on doing. Finding a job that probably doesnt pay all that great, but will hopefully be at a smaller company where I will have a chance to experience many different aspects of development. The more I can learn from my first job the better.
